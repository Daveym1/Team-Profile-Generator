# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

A command line app that asks a user a series of questions about their team and then using the answers, creates an HTML file to display the data.


I used node and NPM to install the required packages including:
- [inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- [file-system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-system) 

I also installed [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running tests.

## User Story

AS a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

----

## Features

The app uses inquirer.js to prompt the user with questions about their team. The users answers are then used to generate an HTML file which displays the team's info.
